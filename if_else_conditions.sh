#!/bin/bash
# In bash, test command is used to evaluate an expression.
# This command accepts a series of arguments which forms an expression when combined.
# When an expression is evaluated, it terminates the command with success 0 exit status code or error 1 exit status code.
# Based on these values, we can check if an expression is true or false.
#
# We use -gt argument to state a greater than operation.
test 5 -gt 9
#In the above example, all the arguments should be in the order given else test would not understand the operation.
#In this case, we are not sure if the expression 5 -gt 9 is true or false as nothing was printed to the terminal.
#In Bash, $? expression prints the status of the last command executed.
echo $?

#test command also has an alias command
#[. Donâ€™t be surprised, it is actually a command.
#You can check that by which [ and it should return /bin/[.
[ 5 -lt 9 ]
echo $?

[ 5 -gt 9 ]
echo $?

# If you have multiple conditional expressions then
# you can use && and || for AND and OR operations respectively.
# We can also use parentheses to combine conditional expressions.
[ 5 -gt 3 ] && [ 6 -lt 5 ]
echo "Result 1: $?"

# If you want to write if and then block on the same line,
